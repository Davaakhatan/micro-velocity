Description: Core project rules and context for the Micro-Velocity mobile game.

Content:
- This project uses a structured Memory Bank in `memory-bank/`:
  - Always read `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and `progress.md` at the start of any substantial task.
  - Update `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` after major changes or at the end of a working session.
- Prioritize:
  - Maintaining the anti-idle design: faster tapping should never be rewarded over staying on-beat.
  - Minimalist, non-overwhelming visual and audio feedback.
  - Preserving the core experience of entering and sustaining a flow state.
- Keep architecture and tech decisions documented in the Memory Bank as they evolve.
