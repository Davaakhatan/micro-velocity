Product Context – Micro-Velocity
================================

## Problem Space

Modern mobile games tend to:
- Reward **constant interaction**, spam-tapping, or grinding.
- Over-stimulate with **excessive visual and audio feedback**.
- Optimize for **retention via extrinsic rewards** (loot, upgrades, streaks).

This can feel exhausting or shallow for players who want something **focused, calming, but still challenging**.

## What Micro-Velocity Aims to Provide

- A **tempo-based experience** where:
  - The **primary challenge is internal**: maintaining rhythm and focus.
  - The game adapts to the player’s natural tempo, not vice versa.
  - The feeling of mastery comes from **synchronization**, not speed or grinding.

- An **“anti-idle” twist**:
  - Instead of being rewarded for doing more, you are rewarded for doing **just enough**, at the **right moment**.
  - There is no advantage to frantic tapping; it actively breaks the flow.

## Target Users

- Players who enjoy:
  - Rhythm/music games but find them too punishing or visually noisy.
  - Mindfulness/meditation apps but want a more game-like loop.
  - Subtle, skill-based mobile games that can be played in short sessions.

- Likely behaviors:
  - Play in 2–10 minute bursts.
  - Seek a **“zone” or flow state** rather than big rewards.
  - Appreciate minimalist, aesthetically pleasing visuals and audio.

## Core Experience Goals

- **Flow Over Frenzy**:
  - Maintain a consistent rhythm with gentle feedback loops.
  - The best sessions feel like a trance-like state, with the UI “disappearing”.

- **Minimalist Visual Design**:
  - Clean shapes, limited color palette, smooth motion.
  - Perfect hits = **small, satisfying micro-feedback**, not screen explosions.

- **Supportive Difficulty**:
  - Missing beats causes the visuals to **slow down or simplify** to help recovery.
  - Avoid sharp fail states like “you lost, restart”; prefer soft resets or re-centering.

- **Session Framing**:
  - Each play session feels like:
    - A short rhythm/attention exercise.
    - Something you can complete and walk away from feeling better, not exhausted.

## High-Level Features (Conceptual)

- **Personalized BPM Sessions**
  - Lightweight calibration at the start.
  - Option to “lock in” a favorite BPM over time.

- **Adaptive Visual Field**
  - Visual tempo indicators (pulses, orbits, waves).
  - Slowdown/smoothing when off-rhythm.

- **Subtle Progression**
  - Track streaks of sync time.
  - Unlock very light cosmetic variations (colors, shapes, trails) based on consistency.
  - Avoid heavy currencies or upgrade trees initially.

## Emotional Tone

- Calm, focused, and slightly hypnotic.
- Celebratory moments are **tiny and refined**, not explosive.
- Missing a beat should feel like: “Breathe, re-center, try again” – not “You failed”.
